				<div class ="AboutItemAnswer" id="OverviewAnswer">
					At ScholarMatch, we believe that our work does not stop until our scholars start their own work. ScholarMatch is joining forces with the community to bridge the gap between college life and the professional world.

				<b>How does the program work?</b>
				<div class ="AboutItemAnswer" id="HowItWorksAnswer">
					Professionals from the community volunteer to be a career coach for a college student throughout the summer. ScholarMatch will connect scholars with career coaches based on career interests and expertise, then facilitat an introduction call between the scholar and the career coach. <br /><br />
					During the introduction call, ScholarMatch staff, the scholar and the career coach will discuss career objectives for the student and map out 3 specific professional goals or skills for the scholar and coach to work on throughout the summer. Examples include: resume review, internship guidance, interview preparation, etc <br /><br />
					After the introduction, the career coach and scholar will begin the collaborations via email, phone or in-person to accomplish the three goals throughout the summer program. The career coach not only helps the scholar master specific professional skills, but also provides tips on how to navigate and become a successful professional in the field. ScholarMatch staff will help structure and guide the collaborations between career coach and scholar and act as a resource throughout the entire program duration.

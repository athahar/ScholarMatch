					College to Career Program Overview

				<hr />
				<h3><b>ScholarMatch Mission</b></h3>
				Our mission is to make college possible for underserved youth by matching students with donors, resources, colleges and professional networks.

				<br /><br />

				<h3><b>Why Professional Networking?</b></h3>
				At ScholarMatch, we believe that our work does not stop until our students begin their own work. Saint Joseph’s University Professor Maria Kefalas indicated “Networking is one of the most important, but neglected elements of the college experience.”  She quotes John Bennett, Director of the Master of Science and executive coaching program at the McColl School of Business stating “Research tells us that between 60 to 80 percent of jobs are found through personal relationships.”   To combat our college students’ lack of professional resources, ScholarMatch is bridging the gap between college life and the professional world by matching students with a Career Coach in their field of study who will support the student in gaining valuable professional and networking skills.
